We can achieve this by introducing additional latent variables to permit a rich class of models to be constructed out ot simple components, as we did with mixture distributions. For each observation $\\textbf{x}_t$ , we introduce a corresponding latent variable $\\textbf{z}_t$, which might be of different type or dimensionality to the observed variable.
